Ansible Odoo Role
=================

An ansible role for installing and configuring Odoo.
The installation happens from a git repository (source), so not from a package.
You can define your own repository and / or version for this.
Only one Odoo instance per host can be installed with this role.

There are also some dependencies:
  * Postgres
  * Git

You might also want to install Nginx or Apache to proxy the requests to your odoo-server process.

I do not use the Ansible dependency system, so you can freely choose which roles you use to install these dependencies.

Role Variables
--------------

```yaml
odoo_user: a dictionary holding all crucial information about the Odoo user and instance
odoo_server_config: a dictionary holding you odoo-server configuration parameters

odoo_directories: list of directories that need to be created
